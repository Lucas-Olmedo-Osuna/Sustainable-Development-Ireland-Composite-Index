Following OECD and JRC (2008): 
1. Theoretical framework
Sustainable Development: Deep Sustainability (Giddings et al., 2002), Substantive Economy (Polanyi, 1957), Social Economy-Circular Economy-Sustainability (Ziegler et al., 2023)
Sustainable Development Goals (framework for indicators selection)
Three dimensions: Environment, Economy, Social
Geography: Local - Small Area Population (18,919 Republic of Ireland)

2. Data selection
Step 1: Preliminary sources identification
Indicators from 4 sources: 
-	Regions 2030 pilot Project. European Regional SDG Indicators (NUTS2) (Vega Rapun et al. 2022 – JRC)
-	European Hanbook for SDG Voluntary Local Reviews (cities, towns) (Siragusa et al., 2022)
-	Regional SDGs Indicators for Ireland 2017 (NUTS3)  ( https://www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/ep/p-rsdgi/regionalsdgsireland2017/int/  
-	Ireland's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) data hub - Geohive – (NUTS3, County, ED) https://irelandsdg.geohive.ie/pages/Goals)

Step 2: Indicator set design

Step 3: Indicator set Version Zero (ISV_0): Compilation
-	Regions 2030 pilot Project. European Regional SDG Indicators (NUTS2 level)  83 indicators 
-	European Hanbook for SDG Voluntary Local Reviews (cities, towns)  72 indicators
-	Regional SDGs Indicators for Ireland 2017 (NUTS3)   73 indicators
-	Ireland's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) data hub – Geohive (NUTS3, County, ED)   59 indicators (Geospatial)
Output step 3: ISV_0 = 287 indicators

Step 4: Indicator set Version One (ISV_1): a) Assign SDG and SDG targets; b) Relevance (local); c) Merging. 
a.	Assign SDG and SDG targets
Total excluded from step 4a: 40.
b. Relevance (local): 
Total excluded from step 4b: 11
c. Merging:
Total excluded from step 4c: 103.

Output from Step 4: ISV_1: 132 

Step 5: Indicator set Version Two (ISV_2): Data availability (local – SAP level) and data quality.
Data at Small Area Population level related to the indicators selected from Step 4 was searched in the following sources: 
-	Government of Ireland – Open data portal (https://data.gov.ie/) (https://gov.ie/)
-	Central Statistics Office (CSO) Ireland (https://data.cso.ie/ )
-	Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (https://gis.epa.ie/GetData/Download )
-	Tailte Éireann – Geohive (https://www.geohive.ie/ )
-	Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) (https://www.seai.ie/data-and-insights/) 
-	Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM) (https://opendata.agriculture.gov.ie/ )
-	Oirechtas (open data) https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/open-data/ 
-	HRB National Drugs Library (https://www.drugsandalcohol.ie/ )
-	Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) (https://www.hpsc.ie) 
-	Health Service Executive (HSE) (https://data.ehealthireland.ie/) 
-	Road Safety Authority (RSA) (https://www.rsa.ie/road-safety/research) 
-	Health and Safety Authority's (HSA) (https://www.hsa.ie )
-	Women for election https://datahub.womenforelection.ie 
-	National Disability Authority (NDA) (https://nda.ie/publications-and-resources/nda-factsheets )
-	Office of Public Works (OPW) (https://www.floodinfo.ie/ )
-	Transparency International Ireland (https://transparency.ie/ )
-	European Commission - Joint Research Centre (JRC) – Urban Data Platform Plus (https://urban.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ ) 
-	European Commission - EU regional and urban development (https://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/information-sources_en )

Data availability was checked for every indicator . 84 indicators were discarded in this step due to the following reasons: 
-	Data specifically for Ireland was not found (8)
-	Data was only found at national level (18) 
-	Data was found/available at some lower spatial level than national but not at local (SAP/ED) level (56), within these: for 8 indicators data was found/available at NUTS2 level; for 13 data was found/available at NUTS3 level; for 29 indicators data was found/available at County level; for 4 indicators data was found/available at HSE region level; for 1 indicator data was found/available at Garda Division level; for 3 indicators data was available at Air Zones level (A-D); for 2 indicators data was found/available for some Functional Urban Areas).
-	Data was found at local level but not available or not Open Access (2).

Output from Step 5: ISV_2: 44

Step 6: Indicators set version 3 (ISV_3): Internal and external review/consultation and final Selection.
A further selection procedure was applied to form ISV_3, this process consisted in a review of the indicators conducted with two senior researchers with expertise on sustainable (rural) development and indicators development (internal review as they are mentors of the fellowship) and a senior researcher with specific expertise on the SDGs and their development at national and subnational level (external review). The review was based on the conceptual soundness and data quality of the indicators of ISV_2 for the purpose of this study.  
Total excluded from step 6: 9 indicators.

Output from Step 6: ISV_3: 35 indicators 

Structure of the indicators, sub-index and index.
Based on Clark, Kavanagh and Bennet (2022, pp. 38-56), Measuring Progress: Economy, Society and Environment in Ireland. Sustainable Progress Index (commissioned by Social Justice Ireland) indicators were grouped by SDGs and later these were grouped into three Sub-Indexes: Economy (SDG8, SDG9), Society (SDG1, SDG3, SDG4, SDG5, SDG16, SDG17) and Environment (SDG2 , SDG6, SDG7, SDG11, SDG15). These three sub-indexes were subsequently grouped into a Sustainable Development Index. 


3. Imputation of missing data
Imputation method: stochastic static attribution based on proportional value of available data with a correction based on territorial proximity with next aggregated level available, usually Electoral Division level on a few exceptional cases Local Electoral Area. (UN, 2011). 
Method: proportional values (average) calculated by ED, assuming residents at ED share similar features. Why not at Small Area level  a few SA high level of Not Stated (missing values), much reduced at ED level. Reasons for choosing this method: data already aggregated by geographic/administrative boundaries (min. Small Area). 

4. Multivariate analysis
Correlation matrix (Pearson) - 2 indicators (SDG4_women_third_level_education and SDG17_no_internet) taken out for calculation of indexes due to high correlation (with SDG4_third_level_education and SDG17_broadband). 
Reliability (Cronbach's alpha).

5. Normalisation
Min-max normalisation, also tested Standardisation (z-scores)

6. Weighting and aggregation
Weighted arithmetic mean following Clark et al. (2022).

7. Uncertainty and sensitivity analysis
Conducted sensitivity analysis for four models A-D, chaning structure (levels), weighting and aggregation methods.
