Following OECD and JRC (2008): 
1. Theoretical framework
Sustainable Development: Deep Sustainability (Giddings et al., 2002), Substantive Economy (Polanyi, 1957), Social Economy-Circular Economy-Sustainability (Ziegler et al., 2023)
Sustainable Development Goals (framework for indicators selection)
Three dimensions: Environment, Economy, Social
Geography: Local - Small Area Population (18,919 Republic of Ireland)

2. Data selection
Step 1: Preliminary sources identification
Indicators from 4 sources: 
-	Regions 2030 pilot Project. European Regional SDG Indicators (NUTS2) (Vega Rapun et al. 2022 – JRC)
-	European Hanbook for SDG Voluntary Local Reviews (cities, towns) (Siragusa et al., 2022)
-	Regional SDGs Indicators for Ireland 2017 (NUTS3)  ( https://www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/ep/p-rsdgi/regionalsdgsireland2017/int/  
-	Ireland's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) data hub - Geohive – (NUTS3, County, ED) https://irelandsdg.geohive.ie/pages/Goals)

Step 2: Indicator set design
SDG	
SDG- target	
Indicator
Label	Source (original)
Description/Comments	
Data (local level/SAP) source for Ireland and Year	
Unit of measurement	
Sign (+/-)

Step 3: Indicator set Version Zero (ISV_0): Compilation
-	Regions 2030 pilot Project. European Regional SDG Indicators (NUTS2 level)  83 indicators 
-	European Hanbook for SDG Voluntary Local Reviews (cities, towns)  72 indicators
-	Regional SDGs Indicators for Ireland 2017 (NUTS3)   73 indicators
-	Ireland's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) data hub – Geohive (NUTS3, County, ED)   59 indicators (Geospatial)
Output step 3: ISV_0 = 287 indicators

3. Imputation of missing data
Stochastic method

4. Multivariate analysis
Correlation matrix (Pearson) and Reliability (Cronbach's alpha).

5. Normalisation
Standardisation (z-scores) and Min-max normalisation

6. Weighting and aggregation
Equal Weighting, PCA/CA, DEA/BoD
Linear aggreagation (2 and 3 aggregated levels); Geometric aggregation; Mean-min function 

7. Uncertainty and sensitivity analysis
8. Back to the data
9. Links to other indicators
10. Visualisation of the results
